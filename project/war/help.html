 <a name="about-to-follow"/> Follows and unfollows take effect in the next edition.  If an editor is "about to follow" a judge, she will start following the judge when the next edition becomes current.  Because she is not currently following that judge, funding votes cast by the judge during the current edition will not benefit from this editor's authority.
