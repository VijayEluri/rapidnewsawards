 <a name="about-to-follow"/>If an editor is "following" a judge, then funding votes the judge makes will benefit from that editor's authority.  If an editor is "about to follow" a judge, she will start following the judge when the next edition becomes current.   Until then, funding votes cast by the judge will not benefit from the editor's authority.
