 <a name="about-to-follow"> Following or about to Follow </a> If an editor is "following" a judge, the judge gets an increase in funding power.  If an editor is "about to follow" a judge, she will start following the judge when the next edition becomes current.   Until then, funding votes cast by the judge will not benefit from the editor's authority.
</div>

<div class="helpItem">

 When newskraft.org publishes the next edition, it becomes the current edition, and all its awards, follows, and unfollows go into effect.  Until then, judges can cancel their awards, and editors can cancel their follows and unfollows. 
</div>

<div class="helpItem"> 
 <a name="follow-unfollow"> Follows and Unfollows </a> If an editor follows a judge, the judge's funding power will increase
when the next edition is published.  An unfollow will result in a
decrease. </div>

<div class="helpItem"> 
 <a name="via"> Via N Editors </a> This shows the number of editors following the judge when the award was given. </div>


<div class="helpItem">
