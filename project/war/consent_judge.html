Lyn Headley, Phd candidate, is conducting a research study to find out more about opportunities and challenges facing new forms of journalism. You have been asked to participate in this study because you are involved or interested in the practice of journalism. There will be approximately 50 participants in this study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the changing nature of journalism in the internet age.

<p>
If you agree to be in this study, the following will happen to you:
<p>
The Rapid News Awards (RNA) software will register your user account in its database and the RNA editors will be enabled to follow and unfollow you.  You will be invited to join the newskraft.org mailing list. You will be enabled to vote for stories in any edition of newskraft.org from the time you join until the end of the final edition.  The process will last approximately 1 month.
<p>
Your actions on the newskraft.org web site and its associated mailing list will be considered public actions and will be posted online publicly in the form of web site records for research and journalism purposes.  The public data will include your chosen nickname, the date and time you joined the site, the date, time and URL of each vote you cast on the site, the hypothetical dollar amount of any hypothetical donation you contribute, and any comment you make on the mailing list.
<p>
Participation in this study may involve some added risks or discomforts. These include:
<p>
1.	You may be called to account for the votes you cast on the site.  You may be unfollowed by an editor for casting votes that do not accord with his or her journalistic values, or criticized by the public for these same votes.  This may cause you discomfort or result in perceived damage to your reputation or credibility.  Your votes, along with any comments you make on the mailing list, are public behavior that will be accessible online to anyone, both during the course of the research and for an indefinite period of time afterward.  This exposure might negatively impact your reputation because of judgments made by others on the basis of your public behavior. Even if you withdraw from the study before it is completed, the public data you have entered up to that point will remain publicly available.
Because this is a research study, there may also be some unknown risks that are currently unforeseeable. You will be informed of any significant new findings. The alternatives to participation in this study are not to participate. 
<p>
Depending on your interest in the larger social context of this debate and its consequences, there may or may not be any direct benefit to you from participating in this study. The investigator, however, may learn more about the opportunities and challenges facing new forms of journalism, and society may benefit from this knowledge. 
<p>
Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw from further participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this study, you may simply stop using the site.
<p>
The PI may remove you from the study without your consent if the PI feels it is in your best interest or the best interest of the study. You may also be withdrawn from the study if you do not follow the instructions given you by the study personnel. 
<p>
You will be told if any important new information is found during the course of this study that may affect your wanting to continue. In compensation for your time, you will receive no payment for participating in this research.   There will be no cost to you for participating in this study.
