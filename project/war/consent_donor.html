<h4> Rapid News Awards </h4>

<p>
Lyn Headley, Phd candidate, is conducting a research study to find out more about opportunities and challenges facing new forms of journalism. You have been asked to participate in this study because you (or your organization) have an interest in supporting journalism research or journalism about journalism, or because you (or your organization) are interested in improving and fostering journalism's ongoing health and development through monetary contribution.  There will be approximately 50 participants in this study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the changing nature of journalism in the internet age.

<p>
If you agree to be in this study, the following will happen to you:

<p>
Your name (or the name of your organization) and hypothetical donation, along with a statement provided by you of your interest in the experiment, will be posted publicly in the form of web site records for research and journalism purposes.  You will be invited to join the newskraft.org mailing list.  Then the Rapid News Awards experiment will proceed to hypothetically allocate your hypothetical donation, along with others, to the producers of a selected set of meritorious journalism stories.  You may or may not follow this experiment by paying attention to it or by communicating about it with others as it proceeds.  Others, including participants in the experiment and members of the public, may or may not contact you or communicate with you about the experiment.

<p>
Your actions on the newskraft.org web site and its associated mailing list will be considered public actions and will be posted online publicly in the form of web site records for research and journalism purposes.  These records will be in the public domain.  The public data will include your name (or the name of your organization), the date and time you joined the site, your hypothetical donation, statement of interest, and any comment you make on the mailing list.

<p>
Participation in this study may involve some added risks or discomforts. These include:
1.	You (or your organization) may be called to account or criticized for your public statement of interest and hypothetical donation.  This may cause you discomfort or result in perceived damage to your reputation or credibility. Your statement and hypothetical donation, along with any comments you make on the mailing list, are public data that will be accessible online to anyone, both during the course of the research and for an indefinite period of time afterward.  This exposure might negatively impact your reputation because of judgments made by others about your public behavior.  Even if you withdraw from the study before it is completed, the public data you have entered up to that point will remain publicly available.
Because this is a research study, there may also be some unknown risks that are currently unforeseeable. You will be informed of any significant new findings. The alternative to participation in this study is not to participate. 

<p>
Depending on your interest in the larger social context of this debate and its consequences, there may or may not be any direct benefit to you from participating in this study. The investigator, however, may learn more about the opportunities and challenges facing new forms of journalism, and society may benefit from this knowledge. 
Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw from further participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this study, you may simply stop using the site.
The PI may remove you from the study without your consent if the PI feels it is in your best interest or the best interest of the study. You may also be withdrawn from the study if you do not follow the instructions given you by the study personnel. 
You will be told if any important new information is found during the course of this study that may affect your wanting to continue. You will receive no payment for participating in this research. There will be no cost to you for participating in this study.
